cpm-file-utils
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iauns/cpm-file-utils.png)](https://travis-ci.org/iauns/cpm-file-utils)

Various cross platform file utilities. If you have the luxury of using boost
in your project, I would highly recommend using boost::filesystem instead of
this module.
